# bi0s Stats

App to check live stats for [team bi0s](bi0s.in).

Huge thanks to [Anikait](https://github.com/br34dcrumb) for helping out with his contributions.

## Install

You can get the stable builds from the [Releases page](https://github.com/sp3p3x/bi0s_stats/releases).

Alternatively, upon every push, a workflow runs which builds an apk. You can download those from the action's artifacts.
